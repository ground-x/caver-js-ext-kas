# Caver-Ext SDK for JavaScript v2 examples

These are examples for the caver-ext SDK for JavaScript version 2 (v2) public documentation.

The caver-ext  SDK for JavaScript v2 Developer Guide contains topics for these examples.

Note: Examples for caver-ext SDK for JavaScript version 1 (v1) are available in the javascriptv3/example_code folder in this repo.

## Prerequisites
To build and run these examples, you'll need:

- caver-ext SDK for JavaScript downloaded and extracted somewhere on your machine
- .env accessKey , secretAccessKey data made in Klaytn Credential (https://console.klaytnapi.com/ko/security/credential)

## Running the examples
Examples are written for either execution in a browser script or in Node.js, usually depending on the use case for each. The two scenarios typically differ in how you supply credentials to the code. These differences are described in the Developer Guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials.html

To run the examples, you'll need to create a shared credentials file. For more information about how to set up a shared credentials file, see Loading Credentials in Node.js from the Shared Credentials File in the AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide.

The Node.js examples are all run from the command line.
